This telegram bot saves information about currency rates from the official website of the Central Bank of Russia up to 01.01.2000, and then converts it to output to the user (you can view currency rates for a specific number, or for a period of dates, this can be done for a specific currency or for all available ones, you can also build graphs by selecting currencies and time intervals that must be displayed on it). To store information, the bot interacts with two databases: one for storing data from the site, the other for storing graphs in order to speed up the bot's work when displaying a graph that was already built once.
